# Global_store
INTRODUCTION
In today's data-driven society, having an intelligent strategy is essential for businesses to thrive. With the availability of numerous data sources, organizations can utilize data to make informed decisions, forecast future events, and achieve their strategic objectives. Continuous visibility into business performance and the ability to measure key performance indicators are crucial for success.
OBJECTIVE
This project aims to use business intelligence tool to analyse the performance of a global superstore. The outcome of this analysis will assist stakeholders in making educated decisions about how to attain their goals.
Dealing with large datasets can be difficult if not approached properly. Recently I build an interactive Power BI dashboard using the Global super store's dataset. Let me take you through the problem statement to bring in more clarity.
ðŸ‘‰ Problem statement:- Global superstore is a retail giant across continents that wants to gain insights about its business to make data-driven decisions. Company management hired a Power BI developer to analyze the dataset which contains sales data for 4 years with more than 50k rows.
ðŸ‘‰ Solution:- After carefully analyzing the dataset following are the major conclusions,
(1) Segments with the highest sales are the consumer segment(more than 50%) - we can target the consumer segment to attain more profitability.
(2) Top 3 regions with the highest sales are - Asia Pacific, Europe, and Usca(more than 75% of the total sales)- if we are thinking about scaling our business then these 3 regions would be most suitable.
(3) Top 'n' profitable customers - by knowing the most common/profitable customers we can give discounts to specific customers or even design some special membership schemes for those customers. This will help us increase our customer retention rate.
(4) Top 5 profit products/ Top 5 loss products - through this insight we can increase our inventory for the profitable products/organize sale event and optimize the loss-making products.
Other useful insights can be seen in the dashboard.
âž¡ Tech stack used - Power BI,PowerPoint
âž¡ Functions used - Power Query(ETL tool), DAX, Relational modelling
I explored the designing part of Power BI in this project which is quite awesome, with tools like effects, background images, shadows, color filling, and fillet.

Hope you all will like it!
